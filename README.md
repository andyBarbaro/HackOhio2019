# HackOhio2019
This project was written with the help of a classmate for the Ohio State University Hackathon in 2019. FastFoodBot is used to keyword search popular fast food restaurants' Twitter pages to identify new items releasing or re-releasing. The project is programmed in Java and utilizes the twitter4j library which allows for fast and easy scraping of Twitter pages using a developer Twitter account. The objective is to create a single location for Twitter users to find new and unique items to try at their favorite fast food restaurants. The code for this project is broken into two separate parts, one to populate the page with previous months worth of information and another part to run remotely and retweet new tweets on a daily basis. Although the second part was never deployed due to costs, spinning up a remote machine to perform this daily task should be easily achievable.
